# Test Strategy - Hacker News Sorting Validation

## Overview

This document outlines our testing approach for validating Hacker News article sorting functionality. We test across multiple browsers, viewports, and scenarios to ensure reliable sorting behavior.

**Testing Goal:** Verify that Hacker News newest articles are properly sorted chronologically with realistic accuracy expectations across different browsers and devices.

## What We're Testing

### Core Functionality

- **Article Sorting:** Verify articles are ordered newest to oldest
- **Data Extraction:** Ensure all article data (title, author, timestamp) is captured correctly
- **Cross-Page Navigation:** Test sorting accuracy across multiple HN pages
- **Error Handling:** Validate behavior when things go wrong

### Browser Coverage

- **Chromium:** Primary browser for fast, reliable testing
- **Firefox:** Secondary browser for comprehensive validation
- **Future:** Safari and Edge support planned

### Device Testing

- **Desktop:** 1920x1080 (primary)
- **Tablet:** 768x1024
- **Mobile:** 375x667

## Risk Assessment

| Risk                 | Likelihood | Impact | Our Approach                                                |
| -------------------- | ---------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Browser differences  | High       | High   | Test both Chromium and Firefox with specific configurations |
| Network issues       | Medium     | Medium | Retry logic and timeout handling                            |
| HN site changes      | Medium     | High   | Flexible selectors and fallback strategies                  |
| Performance problems | Medium     | Medium | Load time monitoring with realistic thresholds              |
| Data quality issues  | Low        | High   | Statistical analysis and anomaly detection                  |

## Testing Approach

### Test Types

**Functional Testing:**

- Sorting accuracy across pages
- Data extraction completeness
- Error handling and recovery
- Cross-browser compatibility

**Performance Testing:**

- Page load times
- Resource usage monitoring
- Cross-browser performance comparison

**API Testing:**

- HN Firebase API validation
- Data consistency between API and UI
- API performance and reliability

**Security Testing:**

- Basic XSS vulnerability checks
- Input validation testing
- Security header validation

### Quality Thresholds

**Sorting Accuracy:** 20% threshold (realistic based on HN's actual behavior)
**Data Completeness:** 90% minimum
**Page Load Time:** Under 5 seconds
**Test Coverage:** All priority browsers and viewports

## Test Execution Strategy

### Test Phases

1. **Smoke Testing:** Quick validation that core functionality works
2. **Regression Testing:** Full test suite across all browsers and viewports
3. **Performance Testing:** Load time and resource usage validation
4. **Security Testing:** Basic vulnerability scanning

### Test Environment

**Requirements:**

- Node.js 18+ with Playwright
- Multiple browser installations
- Network connectivity for live HN testing
- Performance monitoring capabilities

**Test Data:**

- Live HN data for realistic testing
- Mock scenarios for edge cases
- Historical data for trend analysis

## Error Handling

### Test Failures

- **Critical:** Complete functionality failure, security issues
- **High:** Major functionality problems, significant performance issues
- **Medium:** Minor functionality issues, usability problems
- **Low:** Cosmetic issues, documentation gaps

### Recovery Strategy

- Screenshot capture for debugging
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- Graceful degradation when components fail
- Detailed error context and logging

## Reporting

### Test Metrics

- Sorting accuracy percentages
- Cross-browser performance comparison
- Data quality measurements
- Security vulnerability counts

### Report Formats

- **HTML Dashboard:** Interactive results with charts
- **JSON Export:** Structured data for analysis
- **CSV Data:** Raw article data for trending
- **Console Output:** Real-time execution status

## Quality Gates

### Must Pass

- Sorting accuracy ≥ 20%
- Data extraction completeness ≥ 90%
- Page load time < 5 seconds
- No critical security vulnerabilities

### Should Pass

- All browsers complete successfully
- Performance within expected ranges
- Security scans show no high-risk issues
- Reports generate correctly

## Tools & Technologies

### Test Framework

- **Playwright:** Cross-browser automation
- **Custom Utilities:** Statistical analysis and validation
- **Moment.js:** Timestamp parsing and comparison
- **Axios:** API testing and validation

### Monitoring

- **Performance Tracking:** Load times and resource usage
- **Quality Metrics:** Trend analysis and scoring
- **Error Tracking:** Screenshot capture and detailed logging
- **Report Generation:** Multiple formats for different needs

## Continuous Improvement

### Test Optimization

- Monitor test execution times
- Identify and fix flaky tests
- Improve coverage where needed
- Evaluate new tools and approaches

### Process Enhancement

- Regular review of test results
- Update thresholds based on real-world data
- Improve documentation and reporting
- Share learnings with team

## Implementation Notes

### Browser-Specific Considerations

- **Firefox:** Requires longer timeouts and sophisticated DOM handling
- **Chromium:** Faster execution, optimal for CI/CD
- **Mobile:** Responsive design validation across viewports

### Real-World Constraints

- **HN Behavior:** Sorting isn't perfect across page boundaries
- **Network Variability:** Timeout handling and retry logic essential
- **Performance Differences:** Significant variations between browsers

### Test Maintenance

- Regular review of selectors and validation logic
- Update thresholds based on trending data
- Monitor HN changes that might affect tests
- Keep documentation current with implementation
